by making use of brute force search algorithm (BFS).  

## Instructions to run the code  
Navigate to respective folder with python file and run making use of the command: python3 puzzleSolver.py

Now in order to print path run command python3 plot_path.py

Make sure that the python files and text files are in the same directory.

## Instructions for entering the matrix

1. Input for the matrix must be in the form of a matrix

2. Empty cell is denoted by 0 .  

3. Enter the initial node row wise with a space between each element of the row and all elements must be either (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) without any repetition and press enter key after inserting every row
